'''
The agv function will act as the "main" method for your system. dairy_land is a Factory object from the factory.py file.
dairy_land has an attribute "test_complete" that signals if you have completed all of the orders in the test file.
dairy_land.read_order() will return an Order object from the queue. Once you have successfully fulfilled an order to the
correct packer, you may call the order_complete function on the order object to mark it as complete.

IMPORTANT: each time you call the read_order() function, the order at the front of the queue is removed. Do not call the
read_order() function until the previous order has been fulfilled.
