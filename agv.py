The agv function will act as the "main" method for your system. dairy_land is a Factory object from the factory.py file.
dairy_land has an attribute "test_complete" that signals if you have completed all of the orders in the test file.
dairy_land.read_order() will return an Order object from the queue. Once you have successfully fulfilled an order to the
correct packer, you may call the order_complete function on the order object to mark it as complete.

IMPORTANT: each time you call the read_order() function, the order at the front of the queue is removed. Do not call the
read_order() function until the previous order has been fulfilled.

            Begin ARS logic here. Again, this will serve as your main method. After you read an order in the queue,
            your first step should be to determine which packer requires the order and for which type of cheese the
            order is for.
            Each Order object has the following attributes:
            packer: an integer (1, 2 or 3) representing which packer the order is for
            color: a string ('red', 'yellow' or 'blue') representing the color bin to retrieve for the order
            See Order class in factory.py for more details...
            Once you understand how to access attributes of each order object, you need to find out where the closest
            bin is to retrieve for the order
            The next step after finding the nearest bin is obviously to move that bin from its location to the packer
            associated with the order. Depending on whether you are using a robot to move bins to the packers or have 
            a system built that transports the bins to the packers, your logic will differ slightly. 
            Robot:
                1. Move robot to closest bin
                2. Move robot from closest bin to correct packer
                3. Move bin back to open spot 
            System:
                1. Transport closest bin to correct packer

            The rest is for YOU to complete. Always be aware and make sure to update locations of objects when moving 
            around the grid. Remember, you cannot bring a bin to a grid location that is already occupied by another
            bin. You should create a variable that keeps track of the location of empty spots in your grid. Once you've 
            completed an order be sure to call the order_complete() function on your cur_order and read the next order in.
